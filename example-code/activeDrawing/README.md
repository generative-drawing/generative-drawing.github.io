## Visual expression: generative drawing, weaving and pattern making

### Stochastic processes
### Active Drawing
based on the example from Casey Reas and Ben Fry in 'Processing, A handbook for visual designers and artists'.

click and draw to draw with the mouse, see your drawing break up and decay over time
